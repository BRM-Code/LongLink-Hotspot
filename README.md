# LongLink-Hotspot
Code for accepting LoRa packets and adding them to a iroha blockchain
## To run:
Follow the quickstart guide in the iroha documentation but use the genesis block found in this repo.
- I recommend running the iroha instance on a dedicated machine.
- Use python3.9 for the hotspot.
- Refer to SX1302_hal for documentation for talking to the packetforwarder code.
- Check the settings.py and make sure it matches your configuration
